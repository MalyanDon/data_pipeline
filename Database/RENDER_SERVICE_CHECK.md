# 🔍 Render Service Settings Check

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

The error still shows `working-upload-system.js` instead of `app.js`, which means Render is **NOT** using our Dockerfile CMD command.

## 🎯 **Most Likely Cause**

Render has a **"Start Command"** field set in the service settings that's overriding our Dockerfile.

## 🔧 **Immediate Fix Required**

### **Step 1: Check Render Service Settings**
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your service (`financial-etl-pipeline`)
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Look for **"Start Command"** field
5. **If it says anything like:**
   - `node working-upload-system.js`
   - `npm start` (with old package.json)
   - Any custom command

### **Step 2: Clear the Start Command**
1. **Delete/clear** the Start Command field
2. **Leave it empty** so it uses the Dockerfile CMD
3. **Save** the settings

### **Step 3: Force Redeploy**
1. Go to **Manual Deploy** section
2. Click **"Clear build cache & deploy"**
3. This will force a completely fresh build

## 📋 **Expected Result**

After clearing the Start Command:
- ✅ Build should use `CMD ["node", "app.js"]` from Dockerfile
- ✅ No more `working-upload-system.js` error
- ✅ Application should start successfully

## 🚨 **If Start Command is Empty**

If the Start Command field is already empty, then:
1. Render might be caching the old Dockerfile
2. Try the nuclear option below

## 🔥 **Nuclear Option**

If the above doesn't work:
1. **Delete the service** on Render
2. **Create a new service** with the same configuration
3. This ensures no cached settings remain

## 📞 **What to Check**

**Tell me:**
1. **What's in the "Start Command" field?**
2. **Is it empty or does it have a value?**
3. **What happens after clearing it?**

This is almost certainly the root cause of the issue!
